# Welcome to Peiliang Bai's personal page

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to this position, I received my Ph.D. from the department of statistics at the University of Florida. My main research spans in change points detection, high dimensional time series analysis, spatio-temporal data analysis, and machine learning. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/peiliangbai92/peiliangbai92.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
