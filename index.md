### About me
Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology. 

Prior to this position, I received my Ph.D. from the department of statistics at the University of Florida in April 2021, advised by Professor George Michailidis. Before coming to the University of Florida, I was major in mathematics and statistics in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University. 

My main research spans in change points detection, high dimensional time series analysis, spatio-temporal data analysis, and machine learning.
